I learned how crc cheksum works and how to implement it using boost. I learned that cyclic redundant checksum is performed by taking the the first few digit of the binary conversion of the message and perform an xor operation with a set divisor, then take the remaining along with the next few digit of the message and repeat the xor until no more digits remain, then take the final remainder and add it to the message so that if the same operation is done again, there would be no remainder. I also learned to use boost and how to get a connection working and have programs run together with one another and share information between them.
